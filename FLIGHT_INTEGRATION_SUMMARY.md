## 🚀 How It Works

### Step 1: User Searches for Flights
1. User goes to `/flights`
2. Enters search criteria:
   - From: Zanzibar (ZNZ)
   - To: Any destination
   - Date, passengers, class
3. Clicks "Search Flights"
4. **Real API call** to Amadeus
5. Display real flight results

### Step 2: User Selects Flight
1. User clicks "Book Flight"
2. Redirected to booking form
3. Enters passenger details:
   - Name, DOB, passport
   - Contact information
4. Clicks "Continue to Payment"

### Step 3: Booking Created
1. System creates:
   - FlightBooking record (status: pending)
   - FlightPassenger records
   - Payment record (Pesapal)
2. Generates unique booking reference

### Step 4: Payment Processing
1. Redirects to Pesapal payment
2. User completes payment
3. Pesapal callback received
4. Payment verified

### Step 5: Booking Confirmation
1. If payment successful:
   - Confirm booking with Amadeus API
   - Create actual airline booking
   - Update status to 'confirmed'
   - Send confirmation email
2. Display booking confirmation

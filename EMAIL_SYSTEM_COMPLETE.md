## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Configure Email Settings

Add these lines to your `.env` file:

```env

# App Settings (if not already set)

## 📝 Important Notes

1. **Email Sending is Asynchronous-Ready**: All email sends are wrapped in try-catch blocks, so failures won't break your application.

2. **Logging**: All email activities are logged in `storage/logs/laravel.log` for debugging.

3. **Admin Email**: Change `ADMIN_EMAIL` in `.env` to receive notifications.

4. **Customization**: All email templates can be customized in `resources/views/emails/`.

5. **Testing**: Use `MAIL_MAILER=log` during development to log emails instead of sending them.
